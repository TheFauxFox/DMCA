# DMCA - About
First of all, thank you to Michael Reeves for this idea. ([GitHub](https://github.com/michaelreeves08 "GitHub"), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/michaelreeves/ "Twitch"), [YouTube](http://https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves "YouTube"))
He first gave me inspiration for this during a stream, shortly after Twitch announced their stupid DMCA issues publically.
In the absolute basic terms, here's what DMCA does.
- Allows streamers to queue and play songs, as well as add playlists from YouTube
- Listen to the music on their own while everyone watching at home can listen along without it playing on your stream

This project was started and made in my free time, and feel it should remain free to the public. 
Streamers need something to just chill and play music. However, if you're feeling generous, [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/FauxDev "buy me a coffee") &hearts;
It's a simple work-around until Twitch can get their shit together, and setup is pretty damn easy.

## Setup
Head over to the [release page](https://github.com/TheFauxFox/DMCA/releases "release page") and grab the latest version. Run the setup, log into Twitch, and get playing!
If you don't want to use DMCA anymore, you can head over to Twitch's [connections](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections "connections") page and disconnect from DumbMusicCopyrightAvoider.
